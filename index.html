 <h3>Star Wars: Episode I</h3> 
 <p>Episode I, in my own opinion, is one of the best Star Wars films because it introduces the Jedis at the very beginning and what they represent.</p>
 
 <h3>Star Wars: Episode III</h3>
 <p>Episode III has one of my favorite betrayal scenes once Order 66 is executed. The Jedi that fought along side the clone troopers all perished by their own ranks. Fortunately some Jedi were able to survive and go into hiding.</p>
 
 <h3>The Other Guys</h3>
 <p>This film is pure comedy from the beginning to the end. My favorite scene is when Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Samuel L. Jackson jump from a skyscraper into the "bushes" that they were aiming for. </p>
